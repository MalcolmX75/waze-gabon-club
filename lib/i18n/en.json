  "faq.badge": "Frequently asked questions",
  "faq.title": "FAQ",
  "faq.q1.question": "Is Waze free in Gabon?",
  "faq.q1.answer": "Yes, Waze is 100% free worldwide, including in Gabon. No subscription, no hidden fees. You just need an internet connection (Airtel or Moov Africa mobile data).",
  "faq.q2.question": "How does Waze work in Libreville?",
  "faq.q2.answer": "Waze uses GPS data from all connected drivers to calculate the fastest real-time routes. The more Wazers in Libreville, the more accurate the data. That's why your participation matters!",
  "faq.q3.question": "How do I report a traffic jam?",
  "faq.q3.answer": "During navigation, tap the orange bubble icon at the bottom right, then select \"Traffic jam\". Choose the intensity (light, moderate, heavy) and confirm. Other Wazers will be alerted instantly.",
  "faq.q4.question": "Does Waze work offline?",
  "faq.q4.answer": "Waze requires an internet connection for route calculation and real-time alerts. However, if you lose connection during a trip, navigation continues with the last calculated route. Data usage: 10-30 MB/hour.",
  "faq.q5.question": "How do I become a map editor?",
  "faq.q5.answer": "Create a Waze account, then access waze.com/editor from a computer. You can immediately start adding roads and fixing errors in your neighborhood. Changes are reviewed by the community before publication.",
  "faq.q6.question": "Are fuel prices useful on Waze in Gabon?",
  "faq.q6.answer": "In Gabon, fuel prices are set by the government and are the same at all stations. Waze's price feature is therefore less relevant here. However, Waze remains very useful for locating the nearest gas stations on your route.",
  "faq.q7.question": "How do I install Waze on CarPlay / Android Auto?",
  "faq.q7.answer": "Install Waze on your phone, then connect it to your vehicle via USB or Bluetooth. Waze will automatically appear on the dashboard screen. Compatible with most recent vehicles.",
